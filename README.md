# Exploring-Weather-Trends-Porject

In this project , I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends
where I lived to overall global temperature trends.
I created a visualization and prepared a write up describing the similarities and differences
between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. I
extracted the data from CSV file using SQL queries, and preformed the analysis using excel
sheet.
